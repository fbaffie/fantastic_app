# Main maps

Below are some maps summarizing the current flooding situation as well as flooding risk for the coming week.

## Current flow

The map below plots for each flood forecasting station, the ratio of current discharge by the mean annual flood

```{r single_station_map, fig.cap='Map of Norway with all stations used for flood forecasting',}
station_map(stations, selected_nbname = "2.11-narsjo")
```

## Flood warning ratio

The map below plots for each flood forecasting station, the ratio of current discharge by the mean annual flood

## Uncertainty ratio

The map below plots for each flood forecasting station, the ratio of current discharge by the mean annual flood

# Multimodel plots

Multi-model plot for all stations.

```{r defining_variables}

# selected_nbname <- "2.11-narsjo"

# variable_1 <- c("SimRaw", "SimCorr", "SimL50", "SimH50")
# variable_2 <- c("SimRaw", "SimCorr", "SimP50")
# variable_3 <- c("DDD.Sim", "Obs")

```

Blabla

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:single_station_map). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
